# Meet-In-Room - Introduction
Meet-In-Room is a open source video meeting software which is focused in providing features to boost the productivity in an organisation. The software provides several features which will help employes of an organisation to interact with their teams and perform tasks efficiently. I built this software as my solution for Microsoft Engage Program 2020.

## Features
The features are focused to setup a hassle free workflow in an organisation. The software contains following functionalities :-

1. Users can  ```register``` themselves and ```login``` using username and password.
2. Users can ```create a team``` and ```add other members``` of their organistion in their team, this team can be used to conduct meetings where all members can join together through ```video calling```.
3. A ```chat``` feature where participants can ```start conversation before``` the meeting, which can be ```continued during and after the meet``` without disrupting the flow. (Built under Adopt Phase).
4. For better meeting experience, users can ```stop/ resume their video or audio``` during the meeting.
5. Participants tab in meeting window displays the ```list of Participants in Meeting```.
5. Users can ```record``` and ```download``` the meeting.
6. Users can assign tasks to their colleagues using ```Assign Work``` tab in the application.
7. Assignee can ```Accept```/ ```Reject``` the assigned task.
